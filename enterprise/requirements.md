## npmE installation requirements

npmE has been extensively tested on CentOS 6.5 and Ubuntu 14 (Trusty), and is
supported on most recent public Linux distributions. It can run inside a
virtual machine or on standard hardware. Since it can be configured to only
selectively mirror the public registry in addition to your private packages,
its disk space requirements are significantly lighter than other private
registry solutions.
