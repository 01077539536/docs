## npm install npmE

npmE runs locally, on a server you control, with no external dependencies
(mirroring the public registry of course requires external internet access, but
mirroring is optional). Many organizations want this for security, regulatory,
or operational reasons.

As you would expect, npmE is installed using npm! Our installation process asks
you a series of simple questions about your local environment, and sets up all
the services it needs to run.

To get started, [sign up for a trial license](https://staging.npmjs.com/enterprise#contact)
for npm Enterprise. Then simple

```bash
npm install npme
```

The installation process will require the billing email and license key you
received during signup.
