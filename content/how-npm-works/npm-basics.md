# npm Basics

npm is comprised of three primary products:

- the CLI
- the Registry
- the Website

## The CLI

The command line interface, or CLI, is the program that ships
with Node.js or that you can install on your own. In short, it
is what runs when you type `npm <command>` in your terminal.

In addition to many other utilities and features, the npm CLI
affords you the ability to:

- [install packages]
- [publish packages]
- [run scripts]

## The Registry

The registry is a series of services and APIs that allow you
to interface with the database that holds all the npm hosted
packages.

If you'd like a version of the Registry that can live inside
your company firewall, you might want to check out [npm Onsite].
